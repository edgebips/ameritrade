TODO:

- BUG: I've witnessed one case wehre secrets.json ends up with 'null' in it.
Attend to this.

- Make the config argumnet to open() optional, so you can forego the full
  configuration. By default it should operate like config_from_dir(). Simplify.
  A one liner is king.

- In order to fully test the schema, create a script to test out all the order
  types and their responses. Generic output isn't great.

- Document better the way arguments are mapped to the request fields and query
  parameters.

- Process and honor a --verbose flag with a dedicated logger for the API and
  change all the example scripts to use that consistently.

- Document more clearly what the cache is and does, even I cannot remember after
  all this time. Delete it actually... I don't need we really need it.

- Make the construction of Config() use keyword args and use that to connect
  instead of open_with_dir(), so that we can implement ameritrade.check.

- Two-step is how it should be; validate the configuration, add unit tests.

- cache_read, cache_write, as options.

- This script is one that should create the configuration the first time if it
  doesn't exist.

- Add support for PUT and PATCH methods.

- Add argument data types to schema and check them.

- Support positional arguments, maybe?

- Implement unit tests for schema validation, and perhaps move some of it to a
  dedicated module.
