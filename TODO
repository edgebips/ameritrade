TODO:

- Hide account id in logging.info().

- Make changes to options symbol library:
  * Rename to symbols.py
  * Rename generic OptionsSymbol functions to e.g. ParseTdSymbol() functions to be explicit.
  * Support the third type of symbol (with a leading dot).
  * Rename Option.symbol to Option.underlying

- Make the config argument to open() optional, so you can forego the full
  configuration. By default it should operate like config_from_dir(). Simplify.
  A one liner is king.

- In order to fully test the schema, create a script to test out all the order
  types and their responses. Generic output isn't great.

- Document better the way arguments are mapped to the request fields and query
  parameters.

- Process and honor a --verbose flag with a dedicated logger for the API and
  change all the example scripts to use that consistently.

- Document more clearly what the cache is and does, even I cannot remember after
  all this time. Delete it actually... I don't need we really need it.

- Make the construction of Config() use keyword args and use that to connect
  instead of open_with_dir(), so that we can implement ameritrade.check.

- Two-step is how it should be; validate the configuration, add unit tests.

- cache_read, cache_write, as options.

- This script is one that should create the configuration the first time if it
  doesn't exist.

- Add support for PUT and PATCH methods.

- Support the streaming API, it's completely separate.

- Add argument data types to schema and check them.

- Support positional arguments, maybe?

- Implement unit tests for schema validation, and perhaps move some of it to a
  dedicated module.

- Implement automatic logging of all traffic to/from the connection.
